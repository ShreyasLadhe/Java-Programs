# Java-Programs
This is my repository to store the codes for the Scalar Java Course - Mastering the Fundamentals.

All the codes that I practuce for each module can be found in this repository. You can use this repository if you are following the course and get stuck at some point or also use this to enhance your understanding of problem solving and JAVA.

I have performed all the codes in IntelliJ Idea Community Edition as my code editor and Open JDK 21 as my Java Development Kit
